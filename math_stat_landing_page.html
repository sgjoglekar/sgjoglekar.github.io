      <h2>About This Page</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! Here, I’ll be sharing articles I’ve written on a mix of topics and problems that I find interesting or thought-provoking. I’ve grouped them under broad categories to keep things somewhat organized — but beyond that, there’s no strict theme. Just a collection of ideas, insights, and curiosities I’ve enjoyed exploring.</p>

	  <p>This is a classic problem in probability theory, often framed as a puzzle. While the standard solution may seem intuitive at first, it actually relies on subtle assumptions that require careful mathematical justification. In this article, I present the commonly accepted approach, highlight the gaps in its reasoning, and offer a more rigorous argument to support the result.</p>
